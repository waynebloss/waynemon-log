# Move Window To Monitor Command

I wanted a way to move the window from one display to another, just like you can
do in Windows with `Shift+Super+Right/Left`.

## Solution

- Found a script called
[move-to-next-monitor](https://makandracards.com/makandra/12447-how-to-move-a-window-to-the-next-monitor-on-xfce-xubuntu)
which pretty much did the trick.
- It works pretty well, not perfect but usable.

## Requires Packages

- xdotool
- wmctrl

## Files

- [move-to-next-monitor](../../files/home/code/move-to-next-window)
